Updated saved memory
Great! We'll walk through the official dbt documentation together in a structured way. I‚Äôll break things down both technically (so you can master the tool) and in easy-to-understand language (so you can explain it to others or use it in demos/interviews).

üìö PHASE 1: INTRO TO DBT (Foundation)
1. What is dbt?
üîß Technical:
dbt (data build tool) is a command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse by writing SQL SELECT statements. It manages dependencies, testing, documentation, and version control.

üß† Easy Explanation:
Think of dbt as a smart assistant that helps you organize, test, and build your SQL pipelines like software projects. Instead of writing messy queries in random places, you structure them like building blocks.

2. Key Concepts:
Models: SQL files with SELECT statements, materialized into views or tables.

Sources: External data in your warehouse you want to refer to.

Tests: Data quality checks (e.g., no nulls, uniqueness).

Snapshots: Track slowly changing data over time.

Docs: Auto-generate documentation for your models and sources.

‚úÖ Your Goal:
Know what a dbt project looks like.

Know what each core concept is and how it helps.

üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 2: GETTING STARTED
1. Set Up Your Environment
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/get-started

Choose your environment:

dbt Core (open source, CLI-based)

dbt Cloud (UI and easier for teams)

üîß Technical:
Install dbt via pip, initialize a project with dbt init, set up the profiles.yml with your warehouse credentials.

üß† Easy Explanation:
It‚Äôs like setting up your VS Code and project folder. dbt needs to know how to talk to your data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).

‚úÖ Your Goal:
Run dbt init, set up a project.

Connect to a data warehouse (I can help set this up based on your stack).

üß© PHASE 3: BUILDING MODELS
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build

1. Write Your First Model
Create a .sql file in the /models folder with:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- models/my_first_model.sql
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('raw_customers') }}
üîß Technical:

ref() is how dbt tracks dependencies and builds DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).

Materialization (view, table, incremental) is defined in dbt_project.yml or per-model.

üß† Easy Explanation:
You're writing SQL like always, but dbt makes it smart: it keeps track of who uses what and builds everything in the right order.

‚úÖ Your Goal:
Create 2‚Äì3 models with ref().

Understand DAGs with dbt docs generate and dbt docs serve.

üîç PHASE 4: SOURCES, TESTING & DOCUMENTATION
1. Define Sources
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources

YAML:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw
    tables:
      - name: customers
SQL model:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
2. Write Tests
Docs: [https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests]

YAML:

yaml
Copy
Edit
tests:
  - unique
  - not_null
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt test
3. Document Everything
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
‚úÖ Your Goal:
Write at least 1 source, 2 models using it.

Add tests and documentation in YAML.

View auto-generated docs in your browser.

üöÄ PHASE 5: ADVANCED TOPICS
1. Materializations
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations

view, table, incremental, ephemeral

Used for performance optimization

üß† Easy Explanation:
It‚Äôs like choosing whether your SQL query is just a temporary view, a full table, or only updates new rows. Useful when data is large.

2. Jinja & Macros
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros

Use variables and control structures like:

sql
Copy
Edit
{% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE updated_at > (SELECT max(updated_at) FROM {{ this }})
{% endif %}
3. Snapshots
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots

Track slowly changing dimensions over time.

üìÅ PHASE 6: DEPLOYMENT, CI/CD, & USE CASES
1. Run in CI/CD Pipelines
Docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy

Set up GitHub Actions / GitLab CI

Use dbt run, dbt test, dbt docs in your build steps

2. Use Cases You Can Build
Customer segmentation

Product funnel tracking

Marketing attribution

Inventory health dashboards

Revenue reporting pipelines

We can build these one by one together ‚Äî I‚Äôll help with SQL, testing, and documentation.

üìå HOW WE CAN PROCEED
I recommend we follow this weekly learning and building plan:

Week	Goal
1	Understand dbt concepts, set up environment
2	Write models, build DAGs, use sources
3	Add tests, docs, explore materializations
4	Learn Jinja, write macros, add snapshots
5	Build full use case project (like funnel, revenue, or customer insights)
6	Add CI/CD, deploy to dbt Cloud or CLI-based workflow
7+	Optimization, performance tuning, custom packages, dbt extensions

Would you like me to create a local walkthrough for Week 1 right now with setup + model examples? Let me know your stack (Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc.) and I‚Äôll guide accordingly.

What is dbt?
dbt is the industry standard for data transformation. Learn how it can help you transform data and deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like version control, modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation.
dbt is a transformation workflow that helps you get more work done while producing higher quality results. You can use dbt to modularize and centralize your analytics code, while also providing your data team with guardrails typically found in software engineering workflows. Collaborate on data models, version them, and test and document your queries before safely deploying them to production, with monitoring and visibility.
dbt compiles and runs your analytics code against your data platform, enabling you and your team to collaborate on a single source of truth for metrics, insights, and business definitions. This single source of truth, combined with the ability to define tests for your data, reduces errors when logic changes, and alerts you when issues arise.

dbt works alongside your ingestion, visualization, and other data tools, so you can transform data directly in your cloud data platform.
Read more about why we want to enable analysts to work more like software engineers in The dbt Viewpoint. Learn how other data practitioners around the world are using dbt by joining the dbt Community.
dbt
Use dbt to quickly and collaboratively transform data and deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like version control, modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. This means anyone on the data team comfortable with SQL can safely contribute to production-grade data pipelines.
The dbt platform
The dbt platform offers the fastest, most reliable, and scalable way to deploy dbt. Allowing data teams to optimize their data transformation by developing, testing, scheduling, and investigating data models using a single, fully managed service through a web-based user interface (UI).
You can learn about plans and pricing on www.getdbt.com. Learn more about the dbt platform features and try one of the dbtquickstarts.
The dbt Fusion engine
The dbt Fusion Engine is the next-generation dbt engine, designed to deliver data teams a lightning-fast development experience, intelligent cost savings, and improved governance.
For more information, refer to About the dbt Fusion Engine, supported features, and the installation instructions.
dbt Core
dbt Core is an open-source tool that enables data practitioners to transform data and is suitable for users who prefer to manually set up dbt and locally maintain it. You can install dbt Core through the command line. Learn more with the quickstart for dbt Core.
dbt optimizes your workflow
	‚Ä¢	Avoid writing boilerplate DML‚Ä®¬†and DDL‚Ä®by managing transactions, dropping tables, and managing schema changes. Write business logic with just a SQL select statement, or a Python DataFrame, that returns the dataset you need, and dbt takes care of¬†materialization‚Ä®.
	‚Ä¢	Build up reusable, or modular, data models that can be referenced in subsequent work instead of starting at the raw data with every analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Dramatically reduce the time your queries take to run: Leverage metadata to find long-running models that you want to optimize and use incremental models which dbt makes easy to configure and use.
	‚Ä¢	Write DRY‚Ä®er code by leveraging macros, hooks, and package management.
dbt provides more reliable analysis
	‚Ä¢	No longer copy and paste SQL, which can lead to errors when logic changes. Instead, build reusable data models that get pulled into subsequent models and analysis. Change a model once and that change will propagate to all its dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	Publish the canonical version of a particular data model, encapsulating all complex business logic. All analysis on top of this model will incorporate the same business logic without needing to reimplement it.
	‚Ä¢	Use mature source control processes like branching, pull requests, and code reviews.
	‚Ä¢	Write data quality tests quickly and easily on the underlying data. Many analytic errors are caused by edge cases in the data: testing helps analysts find and handle those edge cases.
The power of dbt
As a dbt user, your main focus will be on writing models (select queries) that reflect core business logic ‚Äì there‚Äôs no need to write boilerplate code to create tables and views, or to define the order of execution of your models. Instead, dbt handles turning these models into objects in your warehouse for you.
Feature
Description
Handle boilerplate code to materialize queries as relations
For each model you create, you can easily configure a materialization. A materialization represents a build strategy for your select query ‚Äì the code behind a materialization is robust, boilerplate SQL that wraps your select query in a statement to create a new, or update an existing, relation. Read more about Materializations.
Use a code compiler
SQL files can contain Jinja, a lightweight templating language. Using Jinja in SQL provides a way to use control structures in your queries. For example, if statements and for loops. It also enables repeated SQL to be shared through macros. Read more about Macros.
Determine the order of model execution
Often, when transforming data, it makes sense to do so in a staged approach. dbt provides a mechanism to implement transformations in stages through the ref function. Rather than selecting from existing tables and views in your warehouse, you can select from another model.
Document your dbt project
In the dbt platform, you can auto-generate the documentation when your dbt project runs. dbt provides a mechanism to write, version-control, and share documentation for your dbt models. You can write descriptions (in plain text or markdown) for each model and field. Read more about the Documentation.
Test your models
Tests provide a way to improve the integrity of the SQL in each model by making assertions about the results generated by a model. Build, test, and run your project with a button click or by using the Studio IDE command bar. Read more about writing tests for your models Testing
Manage packages
dbt ships with a package manager, which allows analysts to use and publish both public and private repositories of dbt code which can then be referenced by others. Read more about Package Management.
Load seed files
Often in analytics, raw values need to be mapped to a more readable value (for example, converting a country-code to a country name) or enriched with static or infrequently changing data. These data sources, known as seed files, can be saved as a CSV file in your project and loaded into your data warehouse using the seed command. Read more about Seeds.
Snapshot data
Often, records in a data source are mutable, in that they change over time. This can be difficult to handle in analytics if you want to reconstruct historic values. dbt provides a mechanism to snapshot raw data for a point in time, through use of snapshots.


ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right ‚Äî thank you for pushing for deeper alignment with the actual documentation. Let me now walk through exactly what you pasted from the official docs, section by section, and break it down in both technical and simplified terms, as you requested ‚Äî so you not only understand it like an expert but can also explain it clearly to others.

üß† What is dbt?
"dbt is the industry standard for data transformation..."

‚úÖ Simplified Explanation:
dbt (short for data build tool) helps you transform raw data into clean, usable data using only SQL (and optionally Python). It‚Äôs like a software framework for data teams ‚Äî imagine writing SQL with all the power of software engineering best practices: version control, testing, documentation, and CI/CD.

üîç Technical Breakdown:
Feature	Explanation
Transformation Workflow	dbt operates after data ingestion (e.g., Fivetran) and before visualization (e.g., Looker). It transforms raw data within your warehouse using SQL.
Software Engineering Best Practices	You organize SQL logic into modular, version-controlled scripts with Git. You test models, track lineage, and deploy with CI/CD.
Modularity & Centralization	Models (SQL SELECTs) depend on one another using ref(). dbt builds a dependency graph to execute in the right order.
Single Source of Truth	Each cleaned table you create (like dim_customers) is a source of truth reused in reports, ML models, or dashboards.
Testing & Guardrails	You define tests like uniqueness, non-null, accepted values, and run them automatically.
Deployment	dbt compiles SQL into raw warehouse queries and materializes them (views/tables) using DDL/DML behind the scenes.

üöÄ dbt Makes You Work Like an Engineer
No more copy-pasting SQL across dashboards.

Reuse logic by referencing models.

Update logic once and see it reflected everywhere.

Everything is tested, versioned, and documented.

Run transformations in CI/CD pipelines.

üß± dbt Components & Platform
üîπ dbt Core
Open-source, CLI-based.

Installed via pip and configured via profiles.yml.

Full control, more setup effort.

Run with: dbt run, dbt test, etc.

Use dbt Core if you want flexibility and local development.

üî∑ dbt Cloud
Managed service with web UI, IDE, and scheduling.

Includes role-based access control, job scheduler, and hosted docs.

Easy for teams and CI/CD.

Use dbt Cloud if you want ease of use and collaboration.

üî∂ dbt Fusion Engine (New!)
Next-gen engine with better performance and governance.

Improved speed, cost-efficiency, and intelligent execution.

Compatible with dbt Core and Cloud.

üîÑ How dbt Optimizes Your Workflow
Feature	Technical	Simplified
Avoid Boilerplate	You only write SELECT logic. dbt handles creating tables/views under the hood.	Just write SQL like you always do ‚Äì dbt wraps it in all the complex DDL for you.
Modular Models	Create layers: staging ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí mart. Use ref() to chain logic.	Break your queries into small chunks. Each can be reused by others.
Incremental Models	Only update new data instead of the full table using is_incremental() logic.	Speed up long queries by processing just new rows.
Metadata & Optimization	Use dbt ls, dbt docs to analyze build graph and optimize long-running queries.	Visualize and debug what‚Äôs slow.

üß™ How dbt Ensures Reliable Analysis
Feature	Technical	Simplified
Reusable Models	A change in a base model cascades down to all its dependencies.	Fix it once, and it fixes everything else automatically.
Version Control	Work in Git branches, open PRs, get approvals.	Just like a software engineer ‚Äì track and collaborate with teammates.
Tests	Built-in and custom data tests ensure quality.	Prevent nulls, duplicates, or bad data before it breaks your dashboard.

üß† Core Concepts You Must Master
Concept	Purpose
Model	A .sql file with a SELECT statement. dbt materializes it to a view/table.
ref()	Refers to another model. Builds the DAG.
Source	Declares external raw data in the warehouse.
Test	Validates assumptions (e.g., unique, not_null).
Docs	YAML + markdown + auto docs with dbt docs serve.
Materialization	How dbt builds a model: table, view, incremental, or ephemeral.
Seed	Static data in CSVs loaded into the warehouse.
Snapshot	Versioning changing records (SCD Type 2).
Macros/Jinja	Write reusable SQL logic or config-based SQL templates.
Packages	Import reusable logic from other dbt projects (e.g., dbt_utils).

üîÅ Execution Order
dbt determines model execution using:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('previous_model') }}
It builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and automatically runs models in dependency order.

üì¶ Package Management
Use packages.yml to install useful tools:

yaml
Copy
Edit
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.1.1
Then use macros like:

sql
Copy
Edit
{{ dbt_utils.star(from=ref('table_name')) }}
üß∑ Summary Table (for Cheat Sheet / Interview)
Term	Definition	Example
Model	SQL file for transformation	models/orders.sql
Materialization	How result is stored	view, table, incremental
ref()	Links to another model	SELECT * FROM {{ ref('customers') }}
Test	Assertion on data	unique, not_null
Seed	Static CSV data	data/countries.csv
Snapshot	Capture changes over time	SCD Type 2 logic
Docs	Auto-generated docs	dbt docs generate
Packages	Shared macros/utilities	dbt_utils
Macros/Jinja	Templating in SQL	if, for, etc.

	‚Ä¢	stripe_payments.csv


ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî you're referring to the official dbt Quickstart guide for Amazon Athena, and it‚Äôs a great way to get hands-on. Let me now walk you through this guide step by step, explaining each step in both:

üß† Easy terms (so you can explain to others), and

üîß Technical steps (so you can implement it and go expert level).

üî∞ Overview of What You'll Learn
You'll go from raw CSVs in S3 ‚Üí to clean, tested, documented tables via dbt ‚Üí to scheduled transformations, all using:

Amazon Athena (query engine on S3 data),

dbt Core or dbt Cloud, and

Jaffle Shop dataset.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide
üìÅ 1. Create an S3 Bucket (or Use Existing)
üß† Why?
Athena stores query results (temp tables, logs) in S3. You also store your raw CSV files here.

üîß How?

Go to AWS S3 Console

Click Create bucket

Give a unique name like dbt-athena-demo-2025

Uncheck ‚ÄúBlock all public access‚Äù (optional for sample)

Leave rest default ‚Üí Click Create

üìÇ 2. Upload Sample CSVs
üß† Why?
The Jaffle Shop dataset is mock data that simulates an e-commerce business. It gives you customers, orders, and payments.

üîß Do this:

Download the 3 CSVs from:

jaffle_shop_customers.csv

jaffle_shop_orders.csv

stripe_payments.csv

Upload them into a folder like jaffle_data/ inside your S3 bucket.

üßæ 3. Set Up an Athena Database
üß† Why?
Athena needs a database to organize data. It works on top of S3 using SQL.

üîß How?

Go to Amazon Athena Console

Run this in the Query Editor:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE jaffle_shop;
üß∞ 4. Connect dbt to Athena
üß† Why?
You need to configure dbt so it can talk to Athena using your credentials.

üîß Install dbt-athena adapter:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install dbt-athena-community
üîß Create a profile:
In ~/.dbt/profiles.yml, add:

yaml
Copy
Edit
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: athena
      s3_staging_dir: s3://your-bucket-name/athena-staging/
      region_name: us-east-1
      database: jaffle_shop
      schema: dbt_yourname
      work_group: primary
Replace:

your-bucket-name with your actual S3 bucket

dbt_yourname with any schema (Athena uses schema = database here)

üì¶ 5. Initialize a dbt Project
bash
Copy
Edit
dbt init jaffle_project
cd jaffle_project
Follow prompts and choose jaffle_shop profile.

üßÆ 6. Turn a SQL Query into a dbt Model
üß† What is a model?
A model in dbt is just a .sql file with a SELECT query ‚Äî dbt will compile it and create a table/view.

üîß Steps:
Create this file:

models/stg_customers.sql

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
    id AS customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
You‚Äôll also need to define the source for raw.customers.

üìã 7. Add Source Definition
In models/schema.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw
    database: jaffle_shop
    schema: dbt_yourname
    tables:
      - name: customers
‚úÖ 8. Add Tests
Add to the same schema.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
models:
  - name: stg_customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
Run tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt test
üìù 9. Add Documentation
Still in schema.yml, add:

yaml
Copy
Edit
description: This table contains cleaned customer data from raw.customers
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
Browse the auto-generated docs!

üïí 10. Schedule a Job (dbt Cloud Only)
If you're using dbt Cloud:

Go to Jobs

Click Create Job

Name it: jaffle_daily_run

Choose Environment, select models to run

Set schedule (e.g., every 24 hours)

Save and trigger manually to test

üß† Summary (So You Can Explain)
‚Äúdbt helps me build clean data pipelines using just SQL. I took messy CSV data in S3, used Athena to query it, and used dbt to clean, test, document, and schedule it ‚Äî all using software engineering workflows.‚Äù

‚úÖ Want me to guide the exact commands on your machine next?
If you‚Äôre ready, send me:

Your warehouse setup (CLI or dbt Cloud)

Your bucket name and Athena region

Whether you‚Äôve installed dbt and dbt-athena-community

And I‚Äôll walk you through the next part like a coding assistant.

Would you like to proceed with that setup now?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî let's now go through this exact portion of the dbt documentation step-by-step. I‚Äôll walk you through it using the same wording as the docs, adding:

üß† Easy-to-understand meaning, and

üîß Technical precision so you can actually do it.

‚úÖ Section: Configure Amazon Athena
(Source: dbt Docs ‚Üí Athena Quickstart)

üîπ Step 1: Log into Athena Console
Log into your AWS account and navigate to the Athena console.

üß† What‚Äôs happening?
You're entering the tool (Athena) that allows you to run SQL queries directly on data stored in S3.

üîß How?

Open: https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena

Make sure you select the correct region (e.g., us-east-1) at the top right.

üîπ Step 2: Open Query Editor
If this is your first time in the Athena console (in your current AWS Region), click Explore the query editor.

üß† Why?
Athena needs a place to run queries. The query editor is like your SQL command center.

üîß Click:

"Explore the query editor" ‚Üí it opens the SQL editor.

If it's not your first time, the editor opens directly.

üîπ Step 3: Set Up Query Result Location
Open Settings and find the Location of query result field.

üß† Why?
Athena writes temporary outputs and logs of your queries. It needs an S3 folder to store them.

üîß Do this:

Click the gear ‚öôÔ∏è icon (top right of the editor).

Under Query result location, enter:

arduino
Copy
Edit
s3://your-athena-query-results-bucket/
Or use the Browse S3 button to select the bucket you created earlier.

Click Choose, then Save.

üîπ Step 4: Create a Database
In the query editor, run:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE jaffle_shop;
üß† Why?
This creates a logical container (like a folder) to group your tables in Athena.

üîß Click ‚ÄúRun‚Äù after typing the query.

üîπ Step 5: Select the Database
To write into your new database, select it from the Database list on the left menu.

üß† Why?
You want Athena to default to this database when you run queries.

üîß On the left side panel ‚Üí click the dropdown under Database ‚Üí choose jaffle_shop.

üîπ Step 6: Create Tables from Jaffle Shop Data
Access the Jaffle Shop data in the S3 bucket using one of these:

Option i: Manually create the tables
üß† This means writing SQL like this:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE customers (
  id INT,
  first_name STRING,
  last_name STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
  'serialization.format' = ',',
  'field.delim' = ','
)
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/jaffle_data/'
TBLPROPERTIES ('has_encrypted_data'='false');
Option ii: Use Glue Crawler (Recommended)
üß† Why use Glue?
AWS Glue can automatically crawl your S3 files, detect structure, and create external tables for Athena.

üîß Steps:

Go to AWS Glue Console

Create a crawler:

Choose data source ‚Üí your S3 bucket/folder with Jaffle CSVs.

Choose IAM role with read access to S3.

Output ‚Üí choose existing jaffle_shop DB.

Run the crawler ‚Üí it creates the tables for you.

üîπ Step 7: Start Querying
Once the tables have been created, you will be able to SELECT from them.

üß† Now you‚Äôre ready!
Try:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5;
üîß This verifies that your Athena + S3 setup is working correctly.

üß† Summary of What You Just Did
Step	What You Did	Why It Matters
1‚Äì2	Opened Athena Console	Tool to run SQL on S3
3	Configured Query Result Location	Needed for all Athena queries
4	Created jaffle_shop DB	Logical place to group tables
5	Selected DB	Athena knows where to run queries
6	Created tables (via Glue or SQL)	Define the structure of your CSV data
7	Queried the data	Confirm setup is working

Would you like me to help you create the external table DDL for one of your CSVs next, or help you configure the Glue crawler with IAM policy examples?

Let me know your preference, and we‚Äôll continue from here.

You're now in the ‚ÄúSet up security access to Athena‚Äù section of the dbt Quickstart for Athena. This part is crucial because dbt needs a secure way to authenticate with AWS so it can query Athena.

Let‚Äôs walk through both methods as per the docs, explaining what‚Äôs happening and how to do it correctly.

üîê Step: Set Up Security Access to Athena
dbt (via the dbt-athena-community adapter) needs access to Athena. You give it access using AWS credentials ‚Äî either:

‚úÖ Access keys (recommended by dbt), or

üìÑ An AWS credentials file created by the AWS CLI.

‚úÖ Method 1: Use AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (RECOMMENDED)
üß† Why use this?
It's straightforward, especially when setting up dbt locally. dbt will use these keys to authenticate your Athena queries via boto3 (the AWS SDK).

üîß Follow These Steps:
1. Log in to your AWS Console
Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com

2. Click on your name (top-right) ‚Üí Security Credentials
3. In the left menu, click Users
4. Click your username (or the user you created for dbt)
5. Go to the Security credentials tab
6. Click Create access key
Choose "Command Line Interface" as use case

Click Next and then Create Access Key

7. Click Show to view:
aws_access_key_id

aws_secret_access_key

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Save these securely (e.g., in a password manager or .env file). You won‚Äôt be able to view the secret again later.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These in dbt?
Update your ~/.aws/credentials file manually (or use these values in your profiles.yml directly).

Here‚Äôs a sample ~/.aws/credentials file entry:

ini
Copy
Edit
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Or if you're passing credentials in profiles.yml (not recommended for production):

yaml
Copy
Edit
outputs:
  dev:
    type: athena
    ...
    aws_access_key_id: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
üìÑ Method 2: Use AWS Credentials File via AWS CLI
This is helpful if you already use the AWS CLI or prefer profiles.

üîß Follow These Steps:
1. If not already done, install AWS CLI:
bash
Copy
Edit
# macOS
brew install awscli

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install awscli

# Windows (use MSI installer from AWS)
2. Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws configure
You'll be prompted to enter:

AWS Access Key ID

AWS Secret Access Key

Default region name (e.g., us-east-1)

Output format (press enter to leave blank)

This will generate the credentials file automatically.

üßæ Where is this credentials file stored?
Linux/Mac: ~/.aws/credentials

Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials

Example contents:

ini
Copy
Edit
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAxxxxxxxxxx
aws_secret_access_key = abc123xxxxxxxxxx
You can now use this profile in your profiles.yml for dbt:

yaml
Copy
Edit
outputs:
  dev:
    type: athena
    database: jaffle_shop
    schema: dbt_user
    s3_staging_dir: s3://your-bucket/
    region_name: us-east-1
    profile_name: default  # optional, if not using "default"
üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚Äúdbt connects to Amazon Athena using AWS credentials. These credentials can either be set up via access keys or by configuring the AWS CLI. Once the credentials are saved, dbt uses them to authenticate and run queries securely on your data in S3 through Athena.‚Äù

Would you like me to help you generate a full working profiles.yml using your credentials and S3 info?

If yes, share:

Your S3 bucket name for staging

Your Athena region (e.g., us-east-1)

Whether you used access keys or AWS CLI

And I‚Äôll generate the exact working config for you.

ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî you're now at the section of the official dbt Docs ‚Üí Athena Quickstart that covers configuring dbt Cloud to work with Athena.

Let me guide you through this exact part of the documentation, breaking each step into:

üß† Easy explanation

üîß Precise action to take

‚úÖ Step 1: Configure the Athena Connection in dbt Cloud
This is where you create a connection in dbt Cloud to point it to your Athena environment.

üîπ 1. Navigate to Account Settings
Click your account name (bottom-left corner) ‚Üí Account settings

üß† You‚Äôre going into your dbt Cloud workspace configuration.

üîπ 2. Go to Connections ‚Üí New Connection
Click Connections tab ‚Üí then click New connection

üîß You're telling dbt Cloud, "Here's how to reach Athena."

üîπ 3. Select Athena and Fill Required Fields
Click Athena, then fill out these fields:

Field	What It Is	Example
AWS region name	The region where Athena & S3 are hosted	us-east-1
Database (catalog)	Athena database (lowercase only)	jaffle_shop
S3 staging directory	Bucket where Athena writes query logs	s3://your-bucket-name/athena/

üß† This tells dbt Cloud where to run queries (Athena) and where to temporarily store results (S3).

‚úÖ Click Save once filled.

‚úÖ Step 2: Configure the Environment in dbt Cloud
This is where you define how dbt will run, using the connection you just made.

üîπ 1. Go to Deploy ‚Üí Environments
Click Deploy ‚Üí then click Environments

üîß Environments are like ‚Äúruntimes‚Äù ‚Äî separate spaces for production, staging, or development runs.

üîπ 2. Click ‚ÄúCreate Environment‚Äù and Set General Info
Click Create Environment ‚Üí fill out general settings.

üß† Use a name like ‚ÄúAthena Dev‚Äù or ‚ÄúAthena Prod‚Äù

üß† Choose dbt Version: Set to Versionless (required for Athena connections)

Why? Athena uses the dbt-athena-community adapter which only works with versionless environments in dbt Cloud.

üîπ 3. Link the Athena Connection
From the Connection dropdown ‚Üí select the Athena connection you created in Step 1.

üîπ 4. Provide AWS Credentials & Schema
Fill out:

aws_access_key_id ‚Äî from your IAM user

aws_secret_access_key ‚Äî from same

Schema ‚Äî this is where dbt will create tables (e.g., dbt_yourname)

üß† The "schema" in Athena is the target folder inside your database, often matching your username or project name.

üîπ 5. Test the Connection
Click Test Connection

‚úÖ If successful, dbt confirms it can reach Athena using your credentials.

Then click Save.

üîÑ Repeat for a Development Environment
üß† Why?
You should have at least two environments:

‚úÖ Production (runs on schedule, locked down)

üß™ Development (for you to experiment/test queries)

Repeat the above steps, name it "Athena Dev", and give it:

Same connection

Same AWS keys

Separate schema if needed (e.g., dbt_sid_dev)

üß† Summary (So You Can Explain)
‚ÄúTo connect dbt Cloud to Athena, I created a connection with my AWS region, database, and staging S3 path. Then I created an environment using my access keys, chose the schema where dbt will write, and tested the connection to confirm everything works.‚Äù

Would you like help generating the IAM policy required for minimal Athena + S3 access?

Or are you ready to now move to creating models and running dbt run in Cloud?

Let me know your next step.








You said:
Set up a dbt managed repository
When you develop in dbt, you can leverage Git to version control your code.
To connect to a repository, you can either set up a dbt-hosted managed repository or directly connect to a supported git provider. Managed repositories are a great way to trial dbt without needing to create a new repository. In the long run, it's better to connect to a supported git provider to use features like automation and continuous integration.

To set up a managed repository:
	1	Under "Setup a repository", select Managed.
	2	Type a name for your repo such as bbaggins-dbt-quickstart
	3	Click Create. It will take a few seconds for your repository to be created and imported.
	4	Once you see the "Successfully imported repository," click Continue.


ChatGPT said:
You're now at the section in the official dbt documentation that explains how to set up a dbt-managed repository, which is part of the initial project setup in dbt Cloud.

Let‚Äôs go through this exactly as written in the docs, with:

üß† Simple explanation

üîß Exact steps to follow

‚úÖ Section: Set up a dbt-managed repository
üìö Source: dbt Docs ‚Üí dbt Cloud Quickstart

üß† Why This Step Matters
When working with dbt Cloud, your project code lives in a Git repository.

You can either:

‚úÖ Use a managed repo hosted by dbt (great for beginners & trials), or

üîó Connect to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket (best for production workflows with CI/CD)

The managed repo is perfect for quickstarts and lets you skip Git setup.

üîß Steps to Set Up a Managed Repository
üîπ Step 1: Go to "Setup a Repository" Section
You‚Äôll see this screen after you‚Äôve created an environment (or under Project settings > Repository).

Click Managed under ‚ÄúSetup a repository.‚Äù

üîπ Step 2: Name Your Repository
Type a name like:

Copy
Edit
yourname-dbt-quickstart
üß† This name is only for this dbt-managed Git repo. It helps you identify it if you manage multiple projects.

üîπ Step 3: Click Create
It takes a few seconds for dbt to spin up the repo.

Behind the scenes, dbt creates a Git repo hosted privately by them.

üîπ Step 4: Click Continue When You See Success Message
You‚Äôll see:
‚úÖ Successfully imported repository

Now dbt Cloud links this repo with your environment.

You‚Äôll land in the IDE next ‚Äî where you can start editing models and pushing changes.

üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚Äúdbt projects are Git-backed. I used a dbt-managed repository to quickly get started without having to connect GitHub or GitLab. It works like a normal Git repo ‚Äî I can commit, push, and version-control all my SQL models through the dbt Cloud IDE.‚Äù

Would you like help with:

Using the dbt IDE (commits, branches, running models)?

Connecting your own GitHub repo instead of a managed one?

Or jumping into writing your first model?

Let me know and we‚Äôll go step-by-step.








You said:
Initialize your dbt project and start developing
Now that you have a repository configured, you can initialize your project and start development in dbt:
	1	Click Start developing in the Studio IDE. It might take a few minutes for your project to spin up for the first time as it establishes your git connection, clones your repo, and tests the connection to the warehouse.
	2	Above the file tree to the left, click Initialize dbt project. This builds out your folder structure with example models.
	3	Make your initial commit by clicking Commit and sync. Use the commit message initial commit and click Commit. This creates the first commit to your managed repo and allows you to open a branch where you can add new dbt code.
	4	You can now directly query data from your warehouse and execute dbt run. You can try this out now:
	‚ó¶	Click + Create new file, add this query to the new file, and click Save as to save the new file:select * from jaffle_shop.customers
	‚ó¶	‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®
	‚ó¶	In the command line bar at the bottom, enter dbt run and click Enter. You should see a dbt run succeeded message.

You're now at the section in the dbt documentation that walks through initializing your dbt project and beginning development using dbt Cloud Studio IDE. Let‚Äôs go through it exactly as the docs describe, with full context and guidance:

‚úÖ Section: Initialize Your dbt Project and Start Developing
üìö Source: dbt Cloud Docs ‚Äì Athena Quickstart

üß† Why This Step Matters
You now have:

‚úÖ An Athena connection

‚úÖ An environment

‚úÖ A managed dbt repository

This step initializes your project (i.e., sets up folders and example models) and starts your development workflow using the browser-based Studio IDE.

üîß Step-by-Step Guide
üîπ Step 1: Start Developing in Studio IDE
Click Start developing in the Studio IDE.

üß† This launches the full dbt Cloud IDE ‚Äî your web-based editor that connects your repo, environment, and warehouse.

üîß It may take a few minutes the first time ‚Äî it‚Äôs doing things like:

Cloning your Git repo

Establishing your Athena connection

Testing warehouse access

Wait until the IDE loads fully and you see the file explorer on the left and a terminal at the bottom.

üîπ Step 2: Initialize dbt Project
Above the file tree (left side), click Initialize dbt project.

üß† This creates a working folder structure and some example files:

markdown
Copy
Edit
models/
  example/
    my_first_dbt_model.sql
dbt_project.yml
üîß Think of this like dbt init in CLI ‚Äî it gives you a scaffolded project layout.

üîπ Step 3: Commit Your Changes
Click Commit and Sync in the top-right.

üß† You‚Äôre making your first Git commit into the managed repo.

üîß Use commit message:

sql
Copy
Edit
initial commit
Then click Commit. Now your changes are saved, and you‚Äôre on the main branch.

üîπ Step 4: Run a Query and Try dbt run
You‚Äôre ready to write queries and run dbt commands!

4.1. Create a New File
Click + Create new file in the IDE.

Paste this into the file:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM jaffle_shop.customers
Then click Save as, and name the file (e.g., sample_customers_query.sql).

üß† This verifies your Athena connection and shows you can query data in your configured warehouse.

4.2. Run dbt run
In the command bar at the bottom, type:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt run
Press Enter.

üß† dbt run compiles and executes your models (the .sql files in /models) by running them as CREATE TABLE AS SELECT or CREATE VIEW AS SELECT statements in Athena.

‚úÖ If setup is correct, you‚Äôll see:

arduino
Copy
Edit
dbt run succeeded
üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚ÄúI initialized my dbt project in the Cloud IDE, which created a base folder structure and example files. I made my first Git commit into the managed repository, tested a simple SQL query on Athena, and then ran dbt run to materialize models in my data warehouse.‚Äù

‚úÖ Next Steps
You‚Äôre now ready to:

Create real models in /models/

Refactor queries into modular layers

Add schema.yml with tests and docs

Explore dbt build, dbt test, dbt docs, etc.

Would you like help creating your first real model using the Jaffle Shop data next?

Or shall we move on to understanding ref() and model dependencies?








You said:
Build your first model
You have two options for working with files in the Studio IDE:
	‚Ä¢	Create a new branch (recommended) ‚Äî Create a new branch to edit and commit your changes. Navigate to Version Control on the left sidebar and click Create branch.
	‚Ä¢	Edit in the protected primary branch ‚Äî If you prefer to edit, format, or lint files and execute dbt commands directly in your primary git branch. The Studio IDEprevents commits to the protected branch, so you will be prompted to commit your changes to a new branch.
Name the new branch add-customers-model.
	1	Click the ... next to the models directory, then select Create file.
	2	Name the file customers.sql, then click Create.
	3	Copy the following query into the file and click Save.
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name

    from jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),

final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final

	4	Enter dbt run in the command prompt at the bottom of the screen. You should get a successful run and see the three models.
Later, you can connect your business intelligence (BI) tools to these views and tables so they only read cleaned up data rather than raw data in your BI tool.

You're now at the ‚ÄúBuild your first model‚Äù section of the official dbt documentation for the Athena quickstart ‚Äî a big milestone! ü•≥

Let‚Äôs walk through exactly what the docs say, while I also give you:

üß† A plain English explanation of why you're doing each step

üîß Clear technical actions so you can follow along and run everything successfully

‚úÖ Section: Build Your First Model
üìö Source: dbt Docs ‚Üí Athena Quickstart

üîß Step-by-Step Instructions
üîπ Choose: Create a New Branch (Recommended)
Click Version Control on the left sidebar ‚Üí Click Create Branch

üß† Why?
In dbt Cloud, branches = safe zones to test code changes. You're about to add a new file, so always use a feature branch.

üîß Name the new branch:

csharp
Copy
Edit
add-customers-model
üîπ Step 1: Create a New SQL Model
Click the ... (three dots) next to the models folder ‚Üí click Create file

üîß Name the file:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
customers.sql
Then click Create

üß† A model in dbt is simply a .sql file with a SELECT query. dbt will compile it and turn it into a table or view in Athena.

üîπ Step 2: Copy the SQL Query
Paste the following into customers.sql:

sql
Copy
Edit
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name

    from jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),

final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
‚úÖ Then click Save.

üß† What does this SQL do?
You're combining data from:

customers: basic info

orders: all order history

customer_orders: aggregates per customer

final: merges everything to get a customer summary

This is a dimensional table: one row per customer, including:

Name

First & latest order

Total orders

Perfect for BI dashboards!

üîπ Step 3: Run the Model
At the bottom terminal, type:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt run
üîß This will:

Compile your SQL model

Send it to Athena

Create a table or view in your configured schema (dbt_<your_username>)

‚úÖ You should see output like:

sql
Copy
Edit
Running with dbt=1.7.x
Found 1 model, 0 tests, 0 snapshots, 0 analyses, 179 macros, 0 operations, 0 seed files, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics
...
Finished running 1 view model in 5.29s.
üß† What Just Happened?
‚ÄúI created my first dbt model ‚Äî a SQL file that summarizes customer order behavior. dbt compiled and ran this query on Amazon Athena, creating a view or table that I can now use in dashboards or other models.‚Äù

‚úÖ You can now query this in Athena or your BI tool like:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM dbt_yourname.customers;
üî≠ Next Steps
You‚Äôve now got a full dbt model working. From here you can:

‚úÖ Add schema.yml to document & test the model

‚úÖ Create more models (e.g., orders_summary.sql, revenue.sql)

‚úÖ Use ref() to chain model dependencies

Would you like to move on to adding schema.yml, tests, and documentation next? That‚Äôs the next official step in the guide.

Let me know!

You're now at a very important feature in dbt: materializations ‚Äî i.e., how dbt creates and stores your SQL models in the data warehouse.

Let‚Äôs walk through this step-by-step, exactly as described in the documentation, using:

üß† Simple explanation of what‚Äôs going on

üîß Technical actions to take in dbt Cloud Studio

‚úÖ Section: Change the Way Your Model Is Materialized
üìö Source: dbt Docs ‚Üí Materializations

üß† What Is Materialization in dbt?
When dbt compiles your model (your .sql file), it needs to decide how to save it in the data warehouse. This is called materialization.

Type	Meaning
view	A saved SQL query. Always runs fresh data when queried.
table	A physical table. Data is stored and only updates when dbt run is executed.
incremental	A table that only updates new/changed data.
ephemeral	Only used during run ‚Äî never stored in warehouse.

By default, dbt materializes all models as view.

üîß Step-by-Step Instructions
üîπ Step 1: Edit dbt_project.yml to Change Default Materialization
Open the file: dbt_project.yml

Replace (or update) the relevant part to:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: 'jaffle_shop'

models:
  jaffle_shop:
    +materialized: table
    example:
      +materialized: view
üß† What this does:

Every model inside the jaffle_shop folder will become a table

Every model inside the example folder will remain a view

‚úÖ Click Save

üîπ Step 2: Run the Project
In the terminal, enter:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt run
üß† dbt will now:

Drop the old view (if it existed)

Create a table instead for customers.sql

‚úÖ You should see messages like:

sql
Copy
Edit
> drop view if exists ...
> create table as ...
üîπ Step 3: Override Materialization at Model Level (Optional)
Now, suppose you want only customers.sql to be a view, even though the directory is set to table.

Edit models/customers.sql

Add this block at the top:

sql
Copy
Edit
{{ 
  config(
    materialized='view'
  ) 
}}
Then below that, paste the rest of your SQL query (unchanged).

‚úÖ Click Save

üîπ Step 4: Run With Full Refresh (if needed)
In the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt run --full-refresh
üß† Why --full-refresh?
dbt will drop the existing table (from the last run) and rebuild it as a view based on the new config.

‚úÖ You should now see output like:

sql
Copy
Edit
> drop table if exists ...
> create view as ...
‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚Äúdbt lets you control how each model is saved ‚Äî either as a table (for performance) or as a view (for freshness) ‚Äî just by changing a config value. You can set this globally (in dbt_project.yml) or override it inside an individual model file using config().‚Äù

Would you like to move on to:

Adding tests and documentation to this model?

Creating a model that uses ref() to depend on another model?

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed!








You said:
Delete the example models
You can now delete the files that dbt created when you initialized the project:
	1	Delete the models/example/ directory.
	2	Delete the example: key from your dbt_project.yml file, and any configurations that are listed under it.‚Ä®dbt_project.yml‚Ä®‚Ä®# before
	3	models:
	4	  jaffle_shop:
	5	    +materialized: table
	6	    example:
	7	      +materialized: view
	8	‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®dbt_project.yml‚Ä®‚Ä®# after
	9	models:
	10	  jaffle_shop:
	11	    +materialized: table
	12	‚Ä®‚Ä®Build models on top of other models
As a best practice in SQL, you should separate logic that cleans up your data from logic that transforms your data. You have already started doing this in the existing query by using common table expressions (CTEs).
Now you can experiment by separating the logic out into separate models and using the ref function to build models on top of other models:

The DAG we want for our dbt project
	1	Create a new SQL file, models/stg_customers.sql, with the SQL from the customers CTE in our original query.
	2	Create a second new SQL file, models/stg_orders.sql, with the SQL from the orders CTE in our original query.‚Ä®models/stg_customers.sql‚Ä®‚Ä®select
	3	    id as customer_id,
	4	    first_name,
	5	    last_name

‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®
	13	Save your changes.

Add tests to your models
Adding data tests to a project helps validate that your models are working correctly.
To add data tests to your project:
	1	Create a new YAML file in the modelsdirectory, named models/schema.yml
	2	Add the following contents to the file:‚Ä®models/schema.yml‚Ä®‚Ä®version: 2
	3	
	4	models:
	5	  - name: customers
	6	    columns:
	7	      - name: customer_id
	8	        data_tests:
	9	          - unique
	10	          - not_null
	11	
	12	  - name: stg_customers
	13	    columns:
	14	      - name: customer_id
	15	        data_tests:
	16	          - unique
	17	          - not_null
	18	
	19	  - name: stg_orders
	20	    columns:
	21	      - name: order_id
	22	        data_tests:
	23	          - unique
	24	          - not_null
	25	      - name: status
	26	        data_tests:
	27	          - accepted_values:
	28	              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
	29	      - name: customer_id
	30	        data_tests:
	31	          - not_null
	32	          - relationships:
	33	              to: ref('stg_customers')
	34	              field: customer_id
	35	
	36	‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®
	37	Run dbt test, and confirm that all your tests passed.
When you run dbt test, dbt iterates through your YAML files, and constructs a query for each test. Each query will return the number of records that fail the test. If this number is 0, then the test is successful.



ChatGPT said:
You're now covering three major features of dbt from the documentation ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through them one by one, exactly as described:

‚úÖ 1. Delete the Example Models
üîß Step 1: Delete the /models/example Directory
In the Studio IDE:

Right-click models/example/

Click Delete

This removes the default example models (my_first_dbt_model.sql, etc.).

üîß Step 2: Clean dbt_project.yml
Before:

yaml
Copy
Edit
models:
  jaffle_shop:
    +materialized: table
    example:
      +materialized: view
After:

yaml
Copy
Edit
models:
  jaffle_shop:
    +materialized: table
üß† This ensures dbt doesn't look for a now-deleted example folder.

‚úÖ Save the file and commit your changes.

‚úÖ 2. Build Models on Top of Other Models Using ref()
This is about modularizing your logic ‚Äî a core dbt strength.

üîß Step 1: Create models/stg_customers.sql
Paste this query:

sql
Copy
Edit
select
    id as customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name
from jaffle_shop.customers
‚úÖ Save the file.

üîß Step 2: Create models/stg_orders.sql
Paste this query:

sql
Copy
Edit
select
    id as order_id,
    user_id as customer_id,
    order_date,
    status
from jaffle_shop.orders
‚úÖ Save the file.

üîß Step 3: Update models/customers.sql
Replace the content with:

sql
Copy
Edit
with customers as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}

),

orders as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,
        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders
    from orders
    group by 1

),

final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders
    from customers
    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
‚úÖ Save the file.

üß† Why Use ref()?
dbt uses ref() to build a DAG (dependency graph).

You don‚Äôt need to manually define order.

dbt run will automatically execute in the right sequence:
stg_customers ‚Üí stg_orders ‚Üí customers

üîß Step 4: Run the Project
At the bottom terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt run
‚úÖ You should see all 3 models run:

Copy
Edit
3 of 3 OK
‚úÖ 3. Add Tests to Your Models
üîß Step 1: Create models/schema.yml
Paste the following YAML:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

  - name: stg_customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

  - name: stg_orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_customers')
              field: customer_id
‚úÖ Save the file.

üîß Step 2: Run the Tests
bash
Copy
Edit
dbt test
‚úÖ Output should say:

nginx
Copy
Edit
PASS 10 of 10
üß† What just happened?

dbt translated each test into a query

If the query returns 0 rows, the test passes

If it finds violations (e.g., nulls, bad status values), it shows which test failed

üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚ÄúI split logic into layered models using ref(), so each model handles one task ‚Äî staging, then transforming. Then I added YAML-based tests to validate the quality of my data, like checking for nulls, uniqueness, and valid values.‚Äù

You now have:

‚úÖ A clean DAG of 3 models

‚úÖ Fully documented and tested models

‚úÖ dbt managing dependencies and quality checks

Would you like to move on to:

Auto-generating documentation (dbt docs generate)

Learning about snapshots or incremental models

Setting up CI/CD

Document your models
Adding documentation to your project allows you to describe your models in rich detail, and share that information with your team. Here, we're going to add some basic documentation to our project.
	1	Update your models/schema.yml file to include some descriptions, such as those below.‚Ä®models/schema.yml‚Ä®‚Ä®version: 2
	2	
	3	models:
	4	  - name: customers
	5	    description: One record per customer

You're now on the final foundational step in the dbt Athena quickstart: documenting your models. This is where dbt really shines by enabling your project to be self-describing and shareable with your team through beautiful auto-generated docs.

Let‚Äôs walk through everything exactly as per the official docs ‚Äî with explanations and steps you can follow directly in dbt Cloud Studio.

‚úÖ Section: Document Your Models
üìö Source: dbt Docs ‚Äì Model Documentation

üß† Why Is Documentation Important?
Helps you (and your team) understand what each model does

Adds descriptions for both models and columns

Auto-generates an interactive documentation site via dbt docs

Shows model relationships (lineage) visually

üîß Step-by-Step Instructions
üîπ Step 1: Update models/schema.yml
Open models/schema.yml in the dbt IDE and add the description fields as shown below:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    description: One record per customer
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: first_order_date
        description: NULL when a customer has not yet placed an order.

  - name: stg_customers

          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_customers')
              field: customer_id
‚úÖ Save the file after editing.

üîπ Step 2: Run dbt docs generate
At the bottom terminal in dbt Cloud Studio:

bash
Copy
Edit
dbt docs generate
üß† This command:

Reads all your YAML descriptions and tests

Scans your model SQL files

Connects to your warehouse to gather metadata

Produces a manifest.json + catalog.json that power the docs site

‚úÖ Output should say:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Documentation successfully generated.
üîπ Step 3: View the Documentation
In dbt Cloud Studio:

Click the book icon üìñ on the left sidebar
(It may say ‚ÄúView Docs‚Äù when hovered)

This opens your interactive dbt Docs site in a new tab.

üìò What You Can Do in dbt Docs
Click any model (customers, stg_orders, etc.)

Read descriptions, tests, column-level metadata

View lineage graph ‚Äî how models depend on each other

Click Sources, Tests, or Macros to explore further

üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚ÄúI documented my dbt models by adding descriptions to both the models and their columns in schema.yml. Then I generated auto-documentation using dbt docs generate, and now I can view a full searchable, interactive website showing all my model details and dependencies.‚Äù

‚úÖ With this step, you've now fully completed:

Model creation

Model modularization with ref()

Testing with dbt test

Documentation with dbt docs

You're officially ready for intermediate/advanced topics like:

Incremental models

Snapshots (slowly changing dimensions)

Packages and macros

CI/CD automation

Would you like to move into any of those next?








You said:
Commit your changes
Now that you've built your customer model, you need to commit the changes you made to the project so that the repository has your latest code.
If you edited directly in the protected primary branch:
	1	Click the Commit and sync git button. This action prepares your changes for commit.
	2	A modal titled Commit to a new branchwill appear.
	3	In the modal window, name your new branch add-customers-model. This branches off from your primary branch with your new changes.
	4	Add a commit message, such as "Add customers model, tests, docs" and and commit your changes.
	5	Click Merge this branch to main to add these changes to the main branch on your repo.
If you created a new branch before editing:
	1	Since you already branched out of the primary protected branch, go to  Version Control on the left.
	2	Click Commit and sync to add a message.
	3	Add a commit message, such as "Add customers model, tests, docs."
	4	Click Merge this branch to main to add these changes to the main branch on your repo.


ChatGPT said:
You're now at the final step in your dbt development workflow ‚Äî committing your changes and merging them into the main branch. This is a key part of dbt's Git-based version control.

Let's follow the steps exactly as described in the docs, with:

üß† Simple explanation of why each step matters

üîß Exact actions to perform in dbt Cloud Studio

‚úÖ Section: Commit Your Changes
üìö Source: dbt Cloud Docs ‚Äì Git Workflow

üß† Why Is This Step Important?
All your dbt code lives in a Git repository (managed or connected). To track changes, share with teammates, or deploy to production:

You must commit your changes to a branch

Then merge that branch into main

This is like a normal Git flow ‚Äî dbt Cloud just gives you buttons to do it easily.

üîß You Have Two Paths, Depending on How You Started
‚úÖ OPTION A: You edited in the primary branch (and dbt prevented you from committing)
dbt Cloud automatically blocks commits to main, so it prompts you to create a new branch.

üîπ Step 1: Click Commit and Sync Git
(Top right corner)

üîπ Step 2: A modal appears: "Commit to a new branch"
Branch name:

csharp
Copy
Edit
add-customers-model
Commit message:

sql
Copy
Edit
Add customers model, tests, docs
‚úÖ Click Commit

üîπ Step 3: Merge Your Branch to Main
After the commit, you'll see a button:

Merge this branch to main

‚úÖ Click it to merge your changes into the main branch.

‚úÖ OPTION B: You already created a new branch before editing
In this case, you‚Äôre just committing normally from your working branch.

üîπ Step 1: Click Version Control (left sidebar)
üîπ Step 2: Click Commit and Sync
Add commit message:

sql
Copy
Edit
Add customers model, tests, docs
‚úÖ Click Commit

üîπ Step 3: Merge the Branch
After committing:

Click Merge this branch to main

‚úÖ Your changes are now in the main branch of your dbt repo üéâ

üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚Äúdbt Cloud uses Git under the hood, so I committed my model, tests, and docs into a feature branch and merged that into main. This gives me full version control and enables deployment workflows.‚Äù

You're now fully done with the core dbt quickstart!

Would you like to continue with:

Building incremental models?

Using snapshots to track historical changes?

Deploying jobs in scheduled production workflows?

Setting up CI/CD?

Let me know ‚Äî we can go step-by-step again.

Deploy dbt
Use dbt's Scheduler to deploy your production jobs confidently and build observability into your processes. You'll learn to create a deployment environment and run a job in the following steps.
Create a deployment environment
	1	In the upper left, select Deploy, then click Environments.
	2	Click Create Environment.
	3	In the Name field, write the name of your deployment environment. For example, "Production."
	4	In the dbt Version field, select the latest version from the dropdown.
	5	Under Deployment connection, enter the name of the dataset you want to use as the target, such as "Analytics". This will allow dbt to build and work with that dataset. For some data warehouses, the target dataset may be referred to as a "schema".
	6	Click Save.
Create and run a job
Jobs are a set of dbt commands that you want to run on a schedule. For example, dbt build.
As the jaffle_shop business gains more customers, and those customers create more orders, you will see more records added to your source data. Because you materialized the customers model as a table, you'll need to periodically rebuild your table to ensure that the data stays up-to-date. This update will happen when you run a job.
	1	After creating your deployment environment, you should be directed to the page for a new environment. If not, select Deploy in the upper left, then click Jobs.
	2	Click Create one and provide a name, for example, "Production run", and link to the Environment you just created.
	3	Scroll down to the Execution Settingssection.
	4	Under Commands, add this command as part of your job if you don't see it:
	‚ó¶	dbt build
	5	Select the Generate docs on runcheckbox to automatically generate updated project docs each time your job runs.
	6	For this exercise, do not set a schedule for your project to run ‚Äî while your organization's project should run regularly, there's no need to run this example project on a schedule. Scheduling a job is sometimes referred to as deploying a project.
	7	Select Save, then click Run now to run your job.
	8	Click the run and watch its progress under "Run history."
	9	Once the run is complete, click View Documentation to see the docs for your project.

You're now at the final step of the dbt Cloud Quickstart guide ‚Äî deploying your dbt project using dbt Scheduler. This is how you move from local/interactive development to production-ready, automated pipelines.

Let‚Äôs walk through the deployment instructions exactly as documented, with:

üß† Easy explanations for every concept

üîß Exact actions to perform in dbt Cloud

‚úÖ Section: Deploy dbt
üìö Source: dbt Cloud Docs ‚Üí Scheduler & Deployment

üß† Why This Step Matters
So far, you‚Äôve been running models manually (dbt run)

Now, you‚Äôll automate execution with scheduled jobs

This is what lets you keep tables like customers (which is materialized as a table) up-to-date as source data changes

üîß Step-by-Step Instructions
üî∑ PART 1: Create a Deployment Environment
A deployment environment is where dbt runs production jobs using saved credentials

üîπ Step 1: Go to Deploy ‚Üí Environments
In the top-left of dbt Cloud, click:

Deploy ‚Üí Environments

üîπ Step 2: Click Create Environment
Name:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Production
dbt Version:
Select the latest version from the dropdown (e.g., 1.7.11)

Deployment Connection:

Select your existing Athena connection

For schema / dataset, enter the target schema name, e.g.:

nginx
Copy
Edit
analytics
üß† Note: In Athena, "schema" = a folder within your selected database

‚úÖ Click Save

‚úÖ PART 2: Create and Run a Job
üîπ Step 1: Go to Deploy ‚Üí Jobs
If you were auto-redirected after saving the environment, you‚Äôre already here

If not, navigate to:

Deploy ‚Üí Jobs

üîπ Step 2: Click Create Job
Fill in:

Name:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Production run
Environment:
Choose the Production environment you just created

üîπ Step 3: Set Execution Settings
Under Commands section:

If not already there, add:

nginx
Copy
Edit
dbt build
‚úÖ This will:

Run all models

Run tests

Build dependencies using ref()

‚úÖ Check Generate docs on run

üß† This ensures updated documentation after every run.

üîπ Step 4: Skip the Schedule
For now, do not enable a schedule.

üß† Why?
This is just a demo project ‚Äî no need to run every day/hour yet. In real production, you'd set a cron schedule like every 12 hours.

‚úÖ Click Save

üîπ Step 5: Click Run Now
Your job is now set up! Run it manually:

Click Run now

Watch the progress under Run History

üîπ Step 6: Explore the Results
Once run completes:

‚úÖ Click View Documentation

You‚Äôll see your updated docs (models, columns, tests, lineage)

‚úÖ Explore DAG view

‚úÖ Check logs/output of job run

üß† Summary ‚Äì So You Can Explain
‚ÄúI created a deployment environment with dbt Cloud‚Äôs scheduler, then configured a job that runs dbt build to refresh all models and tests. By enabling documentation generation, I now have an always-updated view of my project‚Äôs logic, lineage, and metadata. This is how dbt becomes production-grade.‚Äù

‚úÖ Your dbt Cloud Quickstart is COMPLETE! üéâ
You‚Äôve now learned:

How to configure connections (Athena)

Build modular models using ref()

Add tests and documentation

Commit with Git

Deploy with dbt Jobs and Scheduler

Would you like to continue with:

Incremental models (only update changed data)?

Snapshots (track historical changes)?

CI/CD automation (pull request runs)?

Advanced Jinja/macros?

Let me know what you‚Äôd like to explore next!
